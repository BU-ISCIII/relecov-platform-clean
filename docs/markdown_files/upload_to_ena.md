# Upload samples to ENA

The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a comprehensive repository that collects, archives,
and disseminates nucleotide sequence data from a variety of organisms, such as influenza, 
coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
It is part of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and offers a platform for researchers
worldwide to share genomic data, providing access to a wide range of data types, including raw
sequencing reads, assembled genomes, and related metadata, supporting both short and long-reads.

Although its a public domain, prior to submitting any samples to ENA you will need to [register](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/submit).
You may find several options to submit your data depending on your informatics skill level.

Relecov-tools already implement a [module](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/relecov-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#upload-to-ena) to upload samples automatically to ENA,
you will only need to install the package, and follow the instructions found in the repository.
